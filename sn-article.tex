\abstract{
Complex networks can represent several real-world scenarios --- biological, social and climate networks, for example. 
They can be understood as generated from random processes, providing a powerful framework for statistical analysis. So, instead of comparing two or more graphs themselves, as in a isomorphism test, it's possible to fit those graphs in random generative processes models with parameters and write tests for those parameters.
We start this chapter by discuss about an case of ANOVA for parameter testing between complex networks.
Then we do a generalization for other kinds of tests, and we finally show some other examples.

\section{Introduction}\label{intro}
The first simple model for representing a random graph is what we call a random network.
In this kind of network the $n$ nodes connect to each other with probability $p$. So the adjacency matrix is given by:

\begin{equation}
A = \left| a_{ij} = 
\begin{cases}
1, & u\geq p \\
0, & u < p \\
\end{cases},
1 \leq i, j, \leq n
\right|
\end{equation}

Although we know well how this collection of graphs behave, we cannot use it in most real-life situations. Instead, we must think of a random process that generates the studied graph.


\subsection{Statistical testing for graphs}
Let $M$ be a random generative process, that may include a set of parameters $\theta$.
Given any number graphs $g_1, g_2, ... $, which we may assume generated by $M$, with parameters respectively $\theta_1, \theta_2, ...$, we create the following hypothesis test:

\begin{equation}
\begin{cases}
H_0: & \theta_1 = \theta_2 = ... = \theta_n \\ 
H_1: & \theta_1 \neq \theta_2 \lor ... \lor \ \theta_{n-1} \neq \theta_n \\
\end{cases}
\end{equation}


With this generalization we can create several kinds of hypothesis testing.

\subsection{Parameter Estimation}
Generally saying, an estimation $\hat\theta$ for a graph $G$ is obtained by maximizing the likelihood function $\mathscr{L}$ in relation to the graph parameters.

\begin{equation}
    \hat\theta_g = \operatorname*{argmax}_{\theta\in\Theta} \mathscr{L}(\theta;G)
\end{equation}

\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

Conclusions may be used to restate your hypothesis or research question, restate your major findings, explain the relevance and the added value of your work, highlight any limitations of your study, describe future directions for research and recommendations. 

In some disciplines use of Discussion or 'Conclusion' is interchangeable. It is not mandatory to use both. Please refer to Journal-level guidance for any specific requirements.

\section{Section title of first appendix}\label{secA1}

An appendix contains supplementary information that is not an essential part of the text itself but which may be helpful in providing a more comprehensive understanding of the research problem or it is information that is too cumbersome to be included in the body of the paper.

%% For submissions to Nature Portfolio Journals %%
%% please use the heading ``Extended Data''.   %%

%% \section{Example of another appendix section}\label{secA2}%
%% Appendices may be used for helpful, supporting or essential material that would otherwise 
%% clutter, break up or be distracting to the text. Appendices can consist of sections, figures, 
%% tables and equations etc.
